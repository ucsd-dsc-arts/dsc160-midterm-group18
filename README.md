## Abstract

The Korean music industry is often seen as a bright and fresh representation of East-Asian creativity that has captured the world’s attention. In this project, we will be taking a look at numerous decades of popular music in Korea from the 1910s to the 2010s to understand the connection between distinctive musical styles and major political events that coincide with them. Part of what makes this possible analysis intriguing is that Korea has been under the cultural influence of two major powers in the last century in addition to dealing with oppressive regimes. Our goal is to try to measure the influence of these events in the difference of genres. Our research question is that do we see similar features in time periods that dealt with similar historical issues, in this case, political repression or economic growth? Our hypothesis is that we will see similarities in periods of great political conflict. To further cognize the influence of political changes, we will be extracting information in forms of features such as Fourier Transforms, MFCCs, temporal, and spectral statistics on a dataset of representative music of each major political era in recent Korean history. Thus we will be able to further attribute certain characteristics towards the political and cultural events, whether positive or negative, that occured within the same timeframe. 

As for the technical process, we will be utilizing jupyterhub and numerous libraries such as Seaborn, matplotlib, and LibROSA to extract and display the features we will be taking into consideration. Our results will be formatted among graphs and charts to give a visual perception of each distinct era of political change to demonstrate if the popular music at that time shared specific elements among each other. We feel like we can make a “timeline” to represent the different features of each area.  We feel as this project will give us further insight into the history of Korean music which has become a global genre in today’s world. Overall, we want to see if there is a correlation between the characteristics of popular Korean music and major political events throughout time, and whether or not the relationship is substantial. 

In terms of dataset, we will be utilizing suggested important songs of each era as outlined in the Sogang University's Professor Huikyong Pang’s class “The Mediums of Korean Cultural Modernity.” In addition, we plan to look at Melon [Korean’s music chart ranking since 2004] chart data for recent popular singles. 


## Data

(10 points) 

This section will describe your data and its origins. Each item should contain a name of the data source, a link to the source, and any necessary background information such as:
- What is your cultural data source? 
- When was it made? 
- Who created the works? 
- Is it digital native, or is it some kind of scan, recording, photo, etc., of an analog form? 

## Code

(20 points)

This section will link to the various code for your project (stored within this repository). Your code should be executable on datahub, should we choose to replicate your result. This includes code for: 

- data acquisition/scraping
- cleaning
- analysis
- generating results. 

Link each of your notebooks or .py files within this section, and provide a brief explanation of what the code does. Reading this section we should have a sense of how to run your code.

## Results

(30 points) 

This section will contain links to documentation of your results. This can include figures, sound files, videos, bitmaps, as appropriate to your domain of analysis. Each result should include a brief textual description, and all should be listed below: 

- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`)
- written text as `.pdf`

## Discussion

(30 points, three to five paragraphs)

The first paragraph should be a short summary describing your results.

The subsequent paragraphs could address questions including:
- Why is this culturally relevant?
- How does your computational approach differ from the traditional art historical, musicological, manuel/subjective approach to analyzing your cultural subject? 
- How do you think the original artists/musicians would respond to this type of analysis? Would it change/inform their practice in some way?
- How do your results relate to broader social, cultural, economic political, etc., issues? 
- In what future directions could you expand this work?

## Team Roles

Provide an account of individual members and their efforts/contributions to the specific tasks you accomplished.

## Technical Notes and Dependencies

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Additional libraries you are using for this project
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does this code need to run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
